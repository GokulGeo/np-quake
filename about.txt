<p>This is a simple implementation of Shiny dashboard to explore the Nepal earthquake (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake) data. The earthquake data used here is NOT real-time. The data was downloaded from USGS (csv format) and can be updated by replacing the file in the data folder. To filter the quakes in the vicinity of Nepal, only the quakes within the bounding box of Nepal map are used. (2/6/2015)
